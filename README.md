**Sleeping Forest** is a VSCode extension for _Unreal Engine 4_ that provides powerful **code-completion** and **command-line features** for programmers and **asset management**, **optimization tools** for designers.

The primary goal is to help in creating data-driven gameplay, optimized level design, shader authoring and faster development iteration through DevOps tools and smart code-completion. **Note that multiplayer is not supported as of yet.**

Note that this the plug-in is **currently in beta** and undergoing improvements. If you want to tag along and suggest features, join [my discord](https://discord.gg/8Qd8a66) to help build the best gamedev extension for vscode !!!

As of now, only Windows support is available for micro-services.

## Feature Overview

### Better intellisense

Configurable setting to override configuration in the .code-workspace file for better search results and faster overall performance. _(Your experience may vary)_

### Contextual auto-completion

150+ snippets and counting.
Constantly updated support towards smart auto-completion at generic/repetitive blocks of code as shown below.

### Class/Header/Function generation

Commands to add templated class files, headers from inside (.h/.cpp) files and automatically adding common functions liek BeginPlay in (.h/.cpp).
These features can be customizing by your own JSON definitions. [See more...](https://suvam0451.netlify.com/docs/sleeping-forest/extension-files)

Also, support for

- **Class generation** for Actors, ActorComponents. [More...]()
- Contextual constructors for Component properties

### Command line tools

Detects engine and project folders and runs generated commands from cmd using tools provided by Epic.
No concrete benchmarks yet but from tests, 50k shaders could be compiled within an hour.

The code compilation features are also solid when you do not want to wait for the engine to load while fixing bugs.

# Micro services(currently only for windows)

The following service tools are currently available for **windows only**. Convenient way to optimize, update and manage assets through concept of asset streams.

### Batch export tool

Assembles information about raw assets in tagged **asset-stream folders** and produces a python file which can be used in UE4 to automatically
import all assets into respective folder structure and settings using python API.

### Texture Packing tool

Able to pack different types of textures into RGBA channels of a single mega texture. This is the feature being currently worked on. Fully supports asset stream workflow.
Supported import extensions are { jpg, tiff, png }, supported output extensions are png and jpg with quality settings

### Asset Audit tool

Every folder is inside an asset stream is scanned and indexed in JSON files. These can be imported into UE4 directly for data driven gameplay elements.

## Building from source

Run `Install.ps1` to run all the pipelines and generate the .vsix file. Install powershell core if you are not on Windows.

Linux

```powershell
sudo apt-get install -y powershell
pwsh
./Install.ps1
```

MacOS

```sh
brew cask install powershell
pwsh
./Install.ps1
```

Windows

```powershell
pwsh.exe
./Install.ps1
```
